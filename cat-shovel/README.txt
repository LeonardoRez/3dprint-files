# Summary

Litter shovel for my cats.

2018 update:
shovel8 - a little smaller and more rigid version. 
Previous version was used for 3 years until plastic degraded and began to crack. Weak parts are the handle and the wall that touches the handle. New version is thiker and will last longer I hope.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: RepRap
Printer: HE3D X-I3
Rafts: No
Supports: Doesn't Matter
Resolution: 0.2, nozzle 0.4
Infill: 50%

Notes: 
I've printed it from ABS, divided in two parts - handle and grid, then glued with acetone+abs.
I advise to print the handle with good adhesion - brim or raft: it's big and can unstick from the bed.
Sketchup file can be used to adjust holes' width.


# Post-Printing

Acetone vapor in PP box for 2..3 hours to make it smooth and glossy.
